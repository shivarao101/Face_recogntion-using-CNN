# Face_recogntion-using-CNN
The project consists of 3 files. face_train.h5, face_test.h5 and h5_pyread.py. 
The raw image files from Yale data base(400 in number) is splitted with an ratio of 80:20 to create face_train.h5(320 in number) and
face_test.h5(80 in number). h5_pyread.py uses convolutional neural network method for classifying Yale data. The training accuracy and 
testing accuracy using this approach was close to 92%.
